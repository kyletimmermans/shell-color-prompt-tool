.TH scpt 1 "November 15, 2024" "SCPT v5.0" "Shell-Color-Prompt-Tool"
.SH NAME
scpt \- Create your own Zsh/Bash terminal prompt from scratch and give it some color, all from the command line
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scpt
[\fIoptions\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Customize your Zsh/Bash terminal prompt with a menu-style selection guide. Choose what info you want the prompt to display (username, hostname, symbols, etc.) and customize their foreground and background colorsâ€”all from the command line. Use brighter colors for extra pop!
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-usage, \-h, \-\-help
Show usage/help menu
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Get program version. Reveal if a newer version is available on GitHub
.TP
.B \-\-uninstall
Undoes the "Install as a Command" installation option. It will delete /usr/local/bin/scpt (program) and the associated man page
.TP
.B \-\-comment\-out
Comment out older prompt lines in .zshrc / .bashrc e.g. PROMPT= / PS1= to help prevent conflicting prompt definitions
.TP
.B \-\-omz
.br
Disables your 'Oh My Zsh' theme if you have one, which could get in the way of applying your new prompt
.TP
.B \-\-light\-mode
Better color contrast for the color picker menu and other various portions on white/light-colored terminal backgrounds. If you plan on using this flag, always put it first, before all other flags/args
.TP
.B \-\-no\-extras
Don't automatically add a newline to the start of the prompt and a space to the end of the prompt
.TP
.B \-\-separate\-file
Place the prompt string in a separate file instead of putting it in .zshrc / .bashrc E.g. --separate-file="~/test.txt"
.TP
.B \-\-no\-watermarks
Don't add the "# Added by Shell-Color-Prompt-Tool" comment to .zshrc / .bashrc when adding the prompt string and don't add the "# Commented out by Shell-Color-Prompt-Tool" comment when using --comment-out or --omz
.TP
.B \-\-char\-table
Display a table of cool UTF-8 characters for copy-and-pasting into prompt part choices. If you can't see the characters or if they show up incorrectly, ensure that your terminal supports the UTF-8 charset
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B scpt \-\-comment\-out \-\-omz \-\-no\-watermarks
Comment out all previous PS1= / PROMPT= / RPROMPT= lines in .zshrc / .bashrc, as well as the ZSH_THEME= line (Oh My Zsh theme). All while not adding any extra comments above any commented lines or above any added prompt lines.
.TP
.B scpt \-\-separate-file="~/test.txt" \-\-no\-extras
Write the prompt into a file called ~/test.txt and have it so the prompt definition doesn't have a newline at the beginning and a space at the end.
.SH USAGE NOTES
.TP
- To add a number as a raw string and to not get it recognized as a menu-number choice, or to add 'n'/'N' and not exit the parts selector, add a '!' before the number or 'n'/'N' e.g. '!14' yields '14' and '!n' yields 'n' and won't exit the parts selector
.TP
- No need to put a space at the end of your prompt, one will be added automatically. Same with a newline at the beginning for proper spacing between actual prompts, one will automatically be added. Disable this feature w/ \fI--no-extras\fP
.TP
- If you want to use the \fI--comment-out\fP or \fI--omz\fP flags, you must have 'gawk' and 'gsed' installed. On Mac, you'll need to install both. On Linux, you just need gawk, as gsed should already be your default sed version
.TP
- \fI--comment-out\fP and \fI--omz\fP can break the config if the variables that are getting commented out, are defined within things like if\-statements or case\-statements
.TP
- Use a text editor such as Vim to view the raw components of the prompt definition in .zshrc / .bashrc, as some text editors have trouble displaying the ANSI escape sequences
.TP
- Fullscreen terminals will be able to fit the spacing and styling of the interactive prompt the best
.TP
- Colors may vary from system to system. When using the Custom RGB option, make sure your terminal supports TRUECOLOR (See github.com/termstandard/colors)
.TP
- If your command is too long, $RPROMPT will visually be temporarily overwritten
.TP
- $RPROMPT cannot contain newlines (\\n)
.TP
- For part option "Custom Datetime", the datetime string is formatted using the 'strftime' function. See strftime(3) for more details. E.g.'%Y-%m-%d %k:%M:%S' would become: '2024-11-09 14:37:34'
