Place the prompt string in a separate file instead of putting it in .zshrc / .bashrc E.g. --separate-file="~/test.txt"
.TP
.B \-\-no\-watermarks
Don't add the "# Added by Shell-Color-Prompt-Tool" comment to .zshrc / .bashrc when adding the prompt string and don't add the "# Commented out by Shell-Color-Prompt-Tool" comment when using --comment-out or --omz
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B scpt \-\-comment\-out \-\-omz \-\-no\-watermarks
Comment out all previous PS1= / PROMPT= / RPROMPT= lines in .zshrc / .bashrc, as well as the ZSH_THEME= line (Oh My Zsh theme). All while not adding any extra comments above any commented lines or above any added prompt lines.
.TP
.B scpt \-\-separate-file="~/test.txt" \-\-no\-extras
Write the prompt into a file called ~/test.txt and have it so the prompt definition doesn't have a newline at the beginning and a space at the end.
.SH USAGE NOTES
.TP
- No need to put a space at the end of your prompt, one will be added automatically. Same with a newline at the beginning for proper spacing between actual prompts, one will automatically be added. Disable this feature w/ \fI--no-extras\fP
.TP
- If you want to use the \fI--comment-out\fP or \fI--omz\fP flags, you must have 'gawk' and 'gsed' installed. On Mac, you'll need to install both. On Linux, you just need gawk, as gsed should already be your default sed version
.TP
- \fI--comment-out\fP and \fI--omz\fP can break the config if the variables that are getting commented out, are defined within things like if\-statements or case\-statements
.TP
- Use a text editor such as Vim to view the raw components of the prompt definition in .zshrc / .bashrc, as some text editors have trouble displaying the ANSI escape sequences
.TP
- Fullscreen terminals will be able to fit the spacing and styling of the interactive prompt the best
.TP
- Colors may vary from system to system. When using the Custom RGB option, make sure your terminal supports TRUECOLOR (See github.com/termstandard/colors)
.TP
- If your command is too long, $RPROMPT will visually be temporarily overwritten
.TP
- $RPROMPT cannot contain newlines (\\n)
